# Reinstall Legacy Apps

Overview:
This is a Python script that removes a Microsoft Store version of the legacy app and installs some legacy apps back into the operating system.

## Legacy Apps:
- mspaint.exe (Paint from Windows 7-10)
- wordpad.exe or write.exe (Wordpad from Windows 7-11 23H2)
- mip.exe (Math Input Panel from Windows 7-10)
- SnippingTool.exe (Snipping Tool from Windows 10 22H2)

## How to Run It?
- Open CMD as an Administrator
- Type cd "C:/{filePathWhereEverYouDownloadedIt}"
- Type "python runThis.py"
- You should have all the stuff properly installed.

To ensure a safe and successful operation, remember to create a restore point as this adds files to your System32 and En-US folder.
